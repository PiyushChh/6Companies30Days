Q299. Bulls and Cows
You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.

The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intuition
First we'll store all values of secret along with the frequency in HashMap.
Now,we'll traverse for Cow & Bull.
The reason why I chose two loops was that in 1 test case,the bull was given preference than the cow.But it had to be vice versa;
So,first we run the loop for cow. Check if element is equal,increase the number of cow by 1 and then decrease in hashmap
Now we run the loop for bull
ccheck if elemens are not equal and the character in guess is there in hashmap(secret) and check if the freq is more than 0,we increase the bull and decrease the frequency in HashMap.

Approach
Hashing

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(N);

Code
class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
        HashMap<Character,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();
        for(int i=0;i<secret.length();i++){
            char ch=secret.charAt(i);
            if(map.containsKey(ch)){
                int val=map.get(ch);
                val=val+1;
                map.put(ch,val);
            }
            else{
                map.put(ch,1);
            }
        }
        int c=0,b=0;
        for(int i=0;i<guess.length();i++){
            char ch=guess.charAt(i);
            char ch1=secret.charAt(i);
            if(ch==ch1){
                c++;
                int val=map.get(ch);
                val=val-1;
                map.put(ch,val);
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<guess.length();i++){
            char ch=guess.charAt(i);
            char ch1=secret.charAt(i);
        if(map.containsKey(ch) && map.get(ch)!=0 && ch!=ch1){
                    b++;
                    int val=map.get(ch);
                val=val-1;
                map.put(ch,val);
                }
        }
       String s=c+"A"+b+"B";
       return s;

    }
